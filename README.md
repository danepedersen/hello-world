This is the Git repo. for the deliverable "Hello World!" activity of assignment 6 of COMP 3521 of TRU-OL.

My name is David Pedersen, and I'm a 25-year-old computer-science student.
I like technological stuff, with the exception of vehicular powertrain electronics.  Those are a mistake in my opinion.

I care about clean air and want everyone to have clean air to breathe.
